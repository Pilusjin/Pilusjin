Hello! My name is Peter Ilusjin. I am a front-end development student at Noroff. I also work as a manager at a car workshop. 
I live in Asker, Norway. The world of tech has always interested me. I am an creative person with a lot of ideas, and i hope that knowledge about development will help me put some of those ideas to life.
